Please use the menu bar above to navigate through this site.

This site provides resources for conducting population genetic analyses in R using existing packages. 
It also provides resources for future package developers to utilize existing classes and methods in creating new packages for population genetic analysis. 

All of the resources here represent contributions from the broader community of R users and developers working in the field of population genetics. New contributions are encouraged. 
<!--
See [here](CONTRIBUTING.html) for instructions on how to contribute workflow vignettes using [R markdown](R_MARKDOWN.html).

This site was developed during the [Population Genetics R hackathon](https://github.com/NESCent/r-popgen-hackathon) held at NESCent on March 16-20, 2015.
